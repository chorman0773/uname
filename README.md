# sysname 

`sysname` is a pure rust implementation of the unix `uname(2)` function (and the corresponding program `uname(1)`). 
It is supported on a number of targets, and doesn't require std (though it typically requires an operating system).

In the future it will also supporting guessing the host system name (like GNU `config.guess`)
